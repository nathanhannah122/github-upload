           <h2>About Us</h2>
           <p>Nathan Hannah</p>
           <p> I chose this topic as the Star Wars franchise is known and loved by so many people around the world, it's fanbase is huge and the story as well as the characters make it for a unique and interesting experience.</p>
           <p>I have enjoyed the Star wars franchise ever since I watched the first film when I was younger as I was fascinated with the all aspects of the film, whether that be characters or the setting etc.</p>
           <p>I am a student at Shipley College, studying the Digital T Level course. This is a two year course which will help me progress to an apprenticeship, work or higher education. 
           Shipley College is the smallest college in the UK, having less than 800 students. It is situated in Saltaire, a world heritage site. Saltaire was built in 1851 by Sir Titus Salt, a leading industrialist in the Yorkshire woollen industry. The name of the village is a combination of the founder's surname and the name of the river. Salt moved his business (five separate mills) from Bradford to this site near Shipley to arrange his workers and to site his large textile mill by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the railway. Salt employed the local architects Francis Lockwood and Richard Mawson.</p>
